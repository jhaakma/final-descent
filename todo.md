## Managers
- Room Manager
    - Stores the list of room types
    - Holds logic for determining next room
    - Room difficulty increases as player descends

## More Rooms
- Unsafe rest rooms

    New Room: HERMIT - "Thank you! Here's something for your trouble"
    - Reward: magic item

## Overarching Story
- Rooms with options to explore, find clues, unravel some sort of plote

## Difficulty Scaling
- Higher difficulty enemies, better items as you descend floors
