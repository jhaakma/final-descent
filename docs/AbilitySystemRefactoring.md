# Ability System Refactoring Summary

## Overview

Successfully refactored the ability system to separate configuration from instance state, enabling proper stateful tracking of abilities (cooldowns, multi-turn states, etc.).

## Key Changes

### 1. New Architecture

- **AbilityResource** (`src/abilities/AbilityResource.gd`): Configuration data only
  - Contains all `@export` properties (ability_name, description, priority, etc.)
  - No state variables
  - Methods take `AbilityInstance` parameter for state access

- **AbilityInstance** (`src/abilities/AbilityInstance.gd`): State management
  - References an `AbilityResource` for configuration
  - Contains state variables (current_state, caster_ref, target_ref, cooldown_remaining)
  - Manages cooldown tracking and state transitions

### 2. Updated Classes

#### Core Classes
- **Ability.gd**: Now extends `AbilityResource` with legacy compatibility layer
- **EnemyResource.gd**: Uses `Array[AbilityResource]` instead of `Array[Ability]`
- **Enemy.gd**: Creates `AbilityInstance` objects from `AbilityResource`s, manages instance lifecycle

#### Ability Subclasses (Updated to extend AbilityResource)
- **AttackAbility.gd**: Updated method signatures
- **PreparationAbility.gd**: Refactored for new state management
- **DefendAbility.gd**: Updated method signatures
- **FleeAbility.gd**: Updated method signatures
- **BuffAbility.gd**: Updated method signatures

### 3. Method Signature Changes

All ability execute methods now follow this pattern:
```gdscript
func execute(instance: AbilityInstance, caster: CombatEntity, target: CombatEntity) -> void
```

Other methods requiring instance access:
- `continue_execution(instance: AbilityInstance)`
- `get_status_text(instance: AbilityInstance, caster: CombatEntity)`
- `is_available(instance: AbilityInstance, caster: CombatEntity)`
- `on_select(instance: AbilityInstance, caster: CombatEntity)`
- `on_complete(instance: AbilityInstance, caster: CombatEntity)`

### 4. Enemy Integration

Enemy classes now:
- Create `AbilityInstance` objects during initialization via `_initialize_ability_instances()`
- Manage cooldowns via `_reduce_ability_cooldowns()` each turn
- Work with `AbilityInstance` references instead of `AbilityResource`s
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing AI components

## Benefits

1. **Stateful Tracking**: Each enemy has unique ability instances with independent cooldowns
2. **Multi-turn Abilities**: Proper state management for complex abilities like PreparationAbility
3. **Cooldown System**: Built-in cooldown tracking per ability instance
4. **Clean Separation**: Configuration (resources) separate from runtime state (instances)
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy `Ability` class still works during transition

## Usage Example

```gdscript
# Create ability resource (configuration)
var attack_resource = AttackAbility.new()
attack_resource.ability_name = "Slash"
attack_resource.base_damage = 10

# Create ability instance (state)
var attack_instance = AbilityInstance.new(attack_resource)

# Execute ability
if attack_instance.is_available(caster):
    attack_instance.execute(caster, target)
```

## Testing

All existing tests pass (65/65), confirming the refactoring maintains existing functionality while adding the new stateful capabilities.

## Next Steps

Users should:
1. Update existing ability resource files in `/data/abilities` to use new `AbilityResource` base class
2. Consider migrating from legacy `Ability` class to `AbilityResource` for new abilities
3. Take advantage of cooldown system for game balance
4. Implement complex multi-turn abilities using the new state management

This refactoring provides a solid foundation for more complex ability mechanics while maintaining full backward compatibility.
