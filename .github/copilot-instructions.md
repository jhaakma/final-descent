- Single Responsibiility Principle: Each mechanic should be put into its own class or function
- Componentisation: Use components to encapsulate related functionality
- Use spaces for indentation
- Put UI formatting into the scene file, rather than code
- Use strict typing
- Avoid "stringly typed" code, don't rely on names etc for logic
- Don't do "Legacy" methods, just update everythiung to use new systems
- Don't write readme files for every change
- Avoid using match statements, use dictionaries
- Add methods as needed, don't add methods "just in case"
